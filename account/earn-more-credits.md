# Earn Credits & More resources
> We have implemented new features allowing YOU to earn more resources on the panel or credits for server renewals! Please read all this carefully, as there are multiple ways to earn credits, so you are not stuck with just one way of earning!

## Status Rewards (Credit Drops)
> By setting your status to ``Zluqe.org | Free Bot Hosting``,  you will automatically be entered into a credit drop giveaway ranging from 250-850 credits!

## Invite Rewards!
> Invite rewards are a great way to start earning credits and resources; for every 5 invites you do, you can earn up to 500 credits (roughly 100 credits per user invited) -- If you are found to be inviting alts, you will be blacklisted from getting ANY rewards in future. 

## Talk!
> By remaining active on the Zluqe server, you can earn credits. Every time you get 10 levels, you can earn credits, resources, or more. You will be notified when you open a ticket and claim your prize. You can earn anywhere from 850-8000 credits. Do keep in mind the more you level up the harder it is to.. level up!

## Contribute to our Projects!
> By making pull requests or helping us with projects (depending on the size and amount of work you put in, you can get up to 500 credits!
